# ❄️ CryoChain: Blockchain-Based Cold Chain & Adverse Event Reporting

CryoChain is a decentralized platform for monitoring vaccine cold chains and logging post-vaccination adverse events (AEFI) using Ethereum smart contracts. It ensures data integrity, transparency, and traceability for public health infrastructure.

---

## 🌍 Why CryoChain?

Traditional vaccine cold chain systems suffer from:
- Temperature breaches going unnoticed
- Lack of public trust in reporting adverse events
- Absence of secure, tamper-proof recordkeeping

**CryoChain solves this** using blockchain and smart contracts to create a fully transparent and immutable record.

---

## 🔐 Features

- Ethereum smart contracts for secure AEFI logging
- Tamper-proof vaccine temperature logs
- Modular design for integration with IoT sensors
- Designed for low-resource or remote regions
- Optional ML module for anomaly detection (planned)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- `Solidity` (Smart Contracts)
- `Python`
- `Ethereum` (Remix / Ganache)
- `IPFS` (optional – for distributed storage)
- `ML (planned)`: scikit-learn / TensorFlow

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Government & NGO vaccination programs
- COVID-19 & booster campaign tracking
- Real-time monitoring during rural immunization drives

---

## 🛠️ Coming Soon

- Frontend DApp using React
- Cold chain hardware integration (IoT sensors)
- Machine learning–powered risk prediction
